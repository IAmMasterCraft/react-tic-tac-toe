# React Tic-Tac-Toe Game 🎮

This React-based Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple yet fun interactive web application 🌐. It was developed using the widely popular [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a robust foundation for React development.

## Features 🌟
- **Interactive 3x3 Game Board 🕹️:** Users can click on the grid to play their turns, marking either 'X' or 'O'.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay ⏳:** The game tracks and displays which player's turn is next.
- **Winning Logic 🏆:** Automatically determines and announces a winner when a player gets 3 in a row.
- **Tie Game Detection 🔍:** Detects and declares a tie if the board is filled without any player winning.
- **Game Reset Functionality 🔄:** A reset button allows players to start a new game at any time.
- **Functional Components 💻:** Built using React functional components for state management and lifecycle methods.
